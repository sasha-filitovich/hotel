              <h3>Fabulous</h3>
              <p>The hosts made us welcome and enjoy our stay from day one. They are very knowledgeable about the area and the nearest ski resorts in Italy and Austria. The location of the hotel is perfect, overlooking the Kranjska gora, across the road from a grocery store and many restaurants nearby. Secure free parking, dry ski room and the sauna is a great bonus to make the stay ever so relaxing. Highly recommended.</p>

              <h3>Fabulous</h3>
              <p>Liked: Great breakfast - very comfortable beds, and above all: very friendly and helpful staff. Would definitily go again.
              Didn't like: all was great - only people I would not recommend the appartment for are disabled people or people who do not like stairs - there is no elevator and you need to use teh stairs to reach every room.</p>
